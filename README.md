# UF2 Dust Calculator
a very stupid application used to calculate stuff for one roblox game</br>
Dont use bosses.db for other projects as its not complete yet, a good amount of connections is missing but i have every enemy and item (i think?)

### Usage
just download, unzip, and open it. Make sure to keep bosses.db in the same directory

### Custom mode
if you are smart enough you can edit bosses.db yourself,
[here is the db editor that i use](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser)
